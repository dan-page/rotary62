## Case
Machined out of 6063 Aluminium and finished in E-White

## Base
Machined out of 6063 Aluminium and anodised black.

## PCB
The PCB was designed to use common components from JLCPCB. Firmware is available from the [QMK Repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

## Silicone Sound Dampener
This includes a 3D printable mould that can be filled with silicone to create a sound dampener for inside the case. After 3D printing the two parts of the mould need glueing together and the seam between the two parts making smooth through sanding and filler. 

## Encoder Knob

## Rubber Feet
Cut from a strip of adhesive-backed 60SH Black Silicone and stuck to the recessed gaps on the base.
